    "# **Project Description and Deliverable**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a scalable and efficient recommender system using Apache Spark’s Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, hosted on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. The project workflow involves the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- creating a new Azure Virtual Machine (VM) that is configured to access data stored in an Azure File Share via a mounted drive.\n",
    "- Within the VM, Docker will be installed to run Spark inside a containerized environment, ensuring portability and ease of management. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Spark application will load data directly from the mounted Azure File Share, enabling seamless interaction with persistent cloud storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recommender system will be developed by applying and iteratively improving the ALS model on the dataset to enhance its prediction accuracy and overall performance. Once the model achieves satisfactory results, it will be saved for production use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To expose the recommendations for real-time usage, an API service will be created, providing endpoints for retrieving personalized product recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A user-friendly frontend web application will be built using Flask, serving as a visualization layer to display recommendations interactively to end-users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The entire system, including the API and frontend, will be deployed and hosted on Azure, leveraging the cloud platform’s scalability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Deliverable**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook on github\n",
    "- Powerpoint presentation recorded to demonstrate the working recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Alignment with Project 6 Requirements: Hands-on with Microsoft Azure**\n",
    "\n",
    "This final recommender system project will fully incorporate the essential Azure components specified in Project 6, demonstrating practical experience with deploying a cloud solution on Microsoft Azure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Persistent Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses Azure File Share, which is part of Azure Storage, to store datasets and the trained ALS model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides long-term, durable, and scalable storage for both input data and model artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mounted Azure File Share is accessed both by the Azure VM running Spark inside Docker and by the Flask application hosted on Azure App Service, ensuring consistent data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Compute Resource**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project provisions an Azure Virtual Machine that runs Docker and hosts Apache Spark inside containers for data processing, model training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained ALS model is then served through a Flask web application deployed on Azure App Service, a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) compute environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-tier compute architecture showcases the use of different Azure compute options: IaaS (VM) and PaaS (App Service).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Network Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure VM is placed within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to isolate and secure network traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate Network Security Groups (NSGs) are configured to restrict inbound and outbound access, ensuring only authorized users and services can connect to the VM and Azure File Share.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the Azure App Service uses private endpoints or VNet integration to securely access the Azure File Share and backend resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup enforces secure communication channels between compute and storage services, complying with best practices for cloud security.\n",

    "**What does RMSE: 1.4384 mean?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) measures how far off your predicted ratings are from the actual user ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, RMSE: 1.4384 means that on average, the predictions are off by about 1.44 rating points.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your ratings are on a scale of 1 to 5 (as in most recommendation datasets), this is moderately accurate, but not optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower RMSE = better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are we improving the ALS model in the code below?\n",
    "\n",
    "In new code block below, I will be explicitly tuning three new ALS hyperparameters not used before that directly affect model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. rank=20:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Controls the number of latent factors used to represent users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** A higher rank allows the model to capture more subtle patterns in user-item interactions, at the cost of more computation and potential overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default is 10, so I am doubling the capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. maxIter=15:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Sets the number of iterations for ALS to alternate between user and item factor updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** More iterations can help the model converge to a better solution — especially useful on larger or sparser datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default is 10, so this gives more training time for better convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. regParam=0.1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Adds regularization to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Too small = overfitting; too large = underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am tuning it from the previous version (which used the default 0.1 or didn't specify), and it's often one of the most impactful parameters.\n"

It then systematically performs a manual grid search over key hyperparameters—rank and regularization—to empirically find the best combination that minimizes test RMSE, ensuring better generalization. Additionally, by enforcing nonnegative latent factors, the model gains improved interpretability and can avoid overfitting. Tracking and selecting the best model based on evaluation results further ensures optimal performance before deployment."

    "The latest results **Test RMSE: 1.2665** and **Train RMSE: 0.3953**  show a solid model fit: the training error is fairly low, meaning the model learns well from the training data, and the test error has improved, indicating better generalization to unseen data. The gap between train and test RMSE suggests some degree of overfitting, but it’s reasonably controlled given the complexity of recommendation tasks. Overall, these numbers reflect that your improvements—like filtering sparse users/items and hyperparameter tuning—are effectively enhancing the ALS model’s predictive performance.\n",

    "# **Conclusion & Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I leveraged the Microsoft Azure platform to design and deploy a scalable, production-ready collaborative filtering recommender system for Amazon Electronics data using PySpark’s ALS algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Solution Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Processing & Filtering: Cleaned and filtered Electronics_5.json to retain relevant users and products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Training & Tuning: Trained a Spark-based ALS model and tuned parameters (rank, regParam), achieving a Test RMSE of 1.2662.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Persistence & Serving: Saved the trained model to Azure-mounted persistent storage and created a Flask-based prediction API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Containerized Deployment: Deployed the entire pipeline (Spark, Flask, Jupyter) within a Docker container on an Azure Virtual Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interactive Interface: Developed API endpoints and began integrating Bootstrap UI to demonstrate prediction capabilities interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Fulfillment of Azure Cloud Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Requirement\tImplementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistent Storage:** Used **Azure File Share mounted to the VM to persist the ALS model under /media/amazonratings/ALS_Model**. This ensures model files are retained across container restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compute Resource:**\tDeployed a Dockerized application on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), acting as the primary compute resource for training, inference, and API serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network Security:**\tConfigured Network Security Group (NSG) rules to only expose ports 8888 (Jupyter) and 8080 (Flask API). Access is restricted to specific IPs where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This solution was built entirely using services available under the Azure Free Account, including File Share (via Storage Account), Azure VM (B1s tier), and manual VNet configuration.\n"
