Step-by-Step: Secure Your Jupyter Notebook on Azure
üîê 1. Set a Password for Jupyter
On your VM, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook password
It will prompt you to enter and confirm a password. This creates a secure hashed password in ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.json.

üõ† 2. Generate a Jupyter Config (if not already)
If that file doesn‚Äôt exist, generate it first:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook --generate-config
This creates:
~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

üîí 3. Edit Config to Bind Jupyter to Specific IP + Disable Token Auth
Open the config file:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
And modify (or uncomment + edit) these lines:

python
Copy
Edit
# Only listen on local IP or your private IP to avoid public exposure
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'  # or use your private IP if behind a firewall

# Require password login
c.NotebookApp.password_required = True

# Disable token-based auth (optional)
c.NotebookApp.token = ''
Optional (but recommended):

python
Copy
Edit
# Prevent browser from auto-opening
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False

# Set port
c.NotebookApp.port = 8888
Save and exit (CTRL + O, then CTRL + X).

üî• 4. Tighten NSG Rule (Highly Recommended)
Right now, anyone on the internet can reach your notebook.

üëâ Update your Azure NSG rule for port 8888:

Set Source to "IP Addresses"

Add your specific public IP (e.g., 45.123.67.89)

This will block others from accessing it

You can find your IP here: https://whatismyipaddress.com/

üöÄ 5. Restart Jupyter Notebook
Make sure you‚Äôre restarting Jupyter so changes take effect:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Or you can run it in the background with:

bash
Copy
Edit
nohup jupyter notebook > notebook.log 2>&1 &
Optional: Use SSH Tunnel Instead (Most Secure)
If you don‚Äôt want to open port 8888 at all, you can use an SSH tunnel:

From your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 youruser@<VM_Public_IP>
Then access it on your local browser at http://localhost:8888

Let me know if you want me to help you:

Tighten the config file

Restrict NSG to your IP

Set up the SSH tunnel

You're almost done ‚Äî just lock it down now! üîê
